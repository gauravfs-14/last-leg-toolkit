    "title": "The \"Last Leg\" Impaired Driving Challenge",
    "content": "Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs remains a persistent highway safety issue, causing over 10,000 deaths annually in the U.S. One emerging challenge is the \"last leg\" of a multimodal trip â€“ when an individual drives to a commuter rail station, takes transit into a city to socialize and consume alcohol, then returns by train and still must drive a few miles home. This toolkit provides comprehensive strategies to address this critical safety gap."
